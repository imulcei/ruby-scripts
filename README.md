Caesar Cipher

Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string:

`> caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
  => "Bmfy f xywnsl!"`

Sub Strings

Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
Next, make sure your method can handle multiple words.

Stock Picker

Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

Bubble Sort

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldn’t it?).
